# Smart Download Organizer (Chrome Extension)

Organize your Chrome downloads automatically into categorized subfolders (Movies, Music, Documents, etc.) under your default **Downloads** folder.

## üß† Features

- Automatically moves new downloads into categorized folders by type
- Lightweight and privacy-friendly (no tracking, no network access)
- Works offline

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `Movies/mp4`, `Music/mp3`, `Documents/pdf`, `Images/jpg`, etc.

## üõ† How It Works

Chrome extensions can no longer move files after download (in Manifest V3), so we use the `onDeterminingFilename` API to **pre-define** where each file should be saved.

Example:
Downloads/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Movies/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mp4/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myvideo.mp4
